# Character Sheet Web App & Generator

## Note from the human in charge of this project

This application was born out of my curiosity to how far Claude can get by itself. I gave it an idea for this project,
but when it comes to the planning, tech stack choice and execution I left it upto it.

One mistake I have made in the beginning was actually asking it to make a plan while logged into my account because it surely was influenced by me developing in .Net, and perhaps it would have chosen a different tech stack if I ran it in anonymous chat instead.
